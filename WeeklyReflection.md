# Weekly Reflection

### Week 6
This week I am finally able to figure out what I'm going to do to catchup with the progress of this application. By the end of this next week I will at least have a database designed and deployed on my local environment.

### Week 8
I have completed the technical aspects of checkpoint 2 but still neeed to refine my DB to support the features i have already implemented. I think the next steps i want to take is to explore authentication, then after that bukd the UI.
